# Emotion_classifier
A general fuzzy classification scheme with the ability to learn using an adaptive network has been developed, </br>
which can be used to recognize emotions, but this approach can be applied to different data. The resulting membership
function was the need to choose a function. The proposed neuro-fuzzy approach is better than neural network classifiers
in the sense that prior knowledge of the training data set can be encoded in the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy classifier. 
The data for training consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces (https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013)
The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.
